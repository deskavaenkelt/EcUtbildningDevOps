# Notes

- The Servers will only be connected to internet while they activate for the free 180-day trial, then they will be connected to a separate network with no external connection att all.
- All Servers will use the same credentials:
    - Administrator Password
    - Separate Users will have the same password
    - To keep it simple, since this is not a production environment.
