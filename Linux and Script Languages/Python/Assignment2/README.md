I have used PyCharm Community from Jetbrains, mainly because I think Jetbrains 
make the best IDEs on the market with the best Intelli Sense functionality and
code highlighting in any IDE I've used. It's very easy to see small errors and 
to actually see when the code won't even compile on beforehand. If I could not 
use PyCharm I would choose IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and added plugins to 
it. Another option is to go with VSCode, but I personally don't like it mainly 
because when I compare Jetbrains products with VSCode it's like comparing word 
with notepad. I choose to do the ToDo app because it has enough complexity to 
be able to add some own functionality without sacrifice too much time.   

In essential Linux is a kernel and what we commonly refer to Linux is actually a
distribution of the Linux kernel with a lot of addons that makes up the entire 
Operating System. Linux is not only used in both desktops and servers but also 
mobile devices, TV's, cars, Internet of Things devices and a lot more. I will use
Linux on a stand-alone server. So I will create my code on macOS with PyCharm and 
create a GitHub repo where the code will be uploaded to. The Linux server will 
clone the repo to a the server and then I'll use the command prompt on the server 
to run my code.

I have installed Ubuntu Server 20.04.1 LTS (Ubuntu VM) on a virtual machine on a 
Proxmox Server located on my local network. I'll use SSH to access the Ubuntu VM 
and to, clone the repo and run the Python program. 

Some services that i know of:
- systemd - System and Service handler
- crond - Command scheduler
- firewalld - Dynamic firewall demon
- httpd - Apache Web Server
- libvirtd - Virtualization demon
- sshd - OpenSSH Server demon
